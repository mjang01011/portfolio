# LangChain

LangChain is an open source framework that allows developers working with AI to combine LLMs with external sources of computation and data.

LLMs knowledge is limited to their training data. Langchain allows you to connect LLM like GPT-4 to your own sources of data. LangChain is data-aware and agentic-aware.
